    Comments:  Fun, if not frustrating, game that meets all requirements

2. 20%: gameplay balance/quality/depth

    Comments:  I am awful at this type of game so I kept getting wrecked... But it seems like a solid fun challenge for people that can handle stealth games, and presumably gets harder as you go on.

    Comments: Enemy AI is solid, I would like to see objects placed on the perimeter so that the flashlight doesn't cut through corners though

4. 10%: aesthetics/design/story

    Grade: 9
    Comments: Hard to read the text and it doesn't scale, but I do enjoy that each level has a journal entry and lore. Otherwise it has an overall consistent, basic aesthetic

5. 10%: Presentation
